# Python-Desktop-Assistant
This project is concerned about an personal desktop assistant which is able to speak and can work as per the voice commands given by the user.I used pyttsx3 library which uses the speech recognition technique to convert speech to text.This desktop assistant can perform activities like showing current time,sending mails,searching wikipedia,playing music,opening web browser etc.
